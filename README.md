# 📈 Real-Time Stock Data Streaming with Kafka + AWS Cloud + Python

> 📌 This is part of the **BWN Project Series — Build With Nishant**, where I build real-world data engineering projects from scratch and share insight step-by-step.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates **real-time stock price data streaming** using **Apache Kafka (locally installed)**. It fetches intraday stock data from a public API, publishes it to a Kafka topic, and consumes the messages to upload them as **Parquet files** into an **Amazon S3** bucket using `boto3`.

```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

All parameters are handled through `config/app_config.yaml`.

---

## 🚀 Kafka Producer

**What it does:**

- Builds API URL for each stock symbol
- Fetches intraday stock data using Alpha Vantage API
- Sends JSON response to Kafka topic: `stock-data-stream`
- Limits to 2 batches per symbol (for testing/demo)
- Sends one record every 30 seconds

> ✅ Uses `kafka-python` to serialize and push data

---

## 🛁 Kafka Consumer

**What it does:**

- Listens to `stock-data-stream` Kafka topic
- Buffers records up to 1000 messages
- Converts the batch to a Parquet file using PyArrow
- Uploads to AWS S3 (`stock_batch_<id>_<timestamp>.parquet`)

---

## 📁 Sample Output Structure in S3

```
s3://<bucket-name>/intraday_data/stock_batch_1_1722243172.parquet
```

---

## 🗃️Sample Data Format (from Producer)

```json
{
  "Meta Data": {
    "1. Information": "Intraday (5min) prices",
    "2. Symbol": "AAPL"
  },
  "Time Series (5min)": {
    "2025-07-29 11:30:00": {
      "1. open": "196.83",
      "2. high": "197.39",
      "3. low": "196.75",
      "4. close": "197.32",
      "5. volume": "1034623"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run (Local Environment)

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Apache Kafka and Zookeeper running locally
  - You can start them using:
    ```bash
    bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
    bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
    ```
- Create the Kafka topic:
  ```bash
  bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic stock-data-stream --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
  ```

### 🏃 Run the Producer

```bash
python producer.py
```

### 🏃 Run the Consumer

```bash
python consumer.py
```

## 🧠 What You'll Learn from This Project

This project is designed to give you hands-on, real-world exposure to the core components of a modern data pipeline. Here’s what you’ll learn

- 📦 **Kafka Basics**: Learn how Apache Kafka works, including setting up a local Kafka environment.
- 🔁 **Producer-Consumer Flow**: Understand how to publish and consume messages using `kafka-python`.
- 🌐 **Fetching APIs**: Use the `requests` library to collect real-time data.
- 🧹 **Pandas Fundamentals**: Perform data cleaning and manipulation using `pandas`.
- 📁 **Working with Parquet**: Learn how to handle Parquet files using `pyarrow` and `pandas`.
- 🔐 **Managing Secrets**: Securely store and access credentials using `dotenv` and environment variables.
- ☁️ **AWS Integration**: Connect your local pipeline with AWS services using `boto3`.
- 📤 **Kafka to AWS Flow**: Understand the end-to-end flow of ingesting data from Kafka and loading it into AWS.
> Perfect for beginners to intermediate data engineers looking to build a real-world data ingestion pipeline.

---

## ✨ Key Highlights

- ⚡ **Real-Time Pipeline**: Demonstrates how to implement a real-time data ingestion pipeline using Kafka.
- 🔄 **Hybrid Processing**: Covers both **streaming** (Kafka Consumer) and **batch buffering** (using in-memory Parquet conversion).
- 📦 **Efficient Storage**: Utilizes `pyarrow` for writing Parquet files efficiently in-memory before uploading to cloud storage.

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

- Normalize nested JSON (e.g., flatten `Time Series`)
- Add schema validation before uploading
- Enhance retry logic and exception handling
- Integrate with Athena/QuickSight for querying
